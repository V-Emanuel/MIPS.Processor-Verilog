MIPS Processor in Verilog. 

This project is the implementation of a single-cycle MIPS processor in Verilog, using the Altera DE2 Development board and the Software Quartus II. This CPU was developed for the conclusion of the Digital Systems Architecture Laboratory course of the Electrical Engineering Graduation at the Federal University of Campina Grande.
